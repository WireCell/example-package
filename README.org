#+title: Example Wire-Cell Toolkit package

This package shows bare-bones skeleton for a package that can be built
against Wire-Cell Toolkit using WCT's own build system.  

It takes a simple form with ~lib/~ directory at top level.  You may also
make a compound package with sub-packages as sub-directories like WCT
itself.

Build, test and install this package much like you would WCT itself:

#+begin_example
  $ ./wcb configure --prefix=/path/to/install \
        --with-wct=$HOME/opt/wct \
        [...maybe other --with-* flags...]
  $ ./wcb
  $ ./wcb install
#+end_example
